# Resource definitions: Opentrons

Company page: [Opentrons Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opentrons)

> Opentrons Labworks, Inc. (or Opentrons) is a biotechnology company that manufactures liquid handling robots that use open-source software, which at one point used open-source hardware but no longer does.

> Founding year: 2014

NB: The [Opentrons Labware Library](https://labware.opentrons.com/) is a wonderful resource to see what Opentrons offers in terms of resources.
However, all definitions use the Opentrons labware definition standard, not the PLR standard.

While PLR has means to convert the Opentrons standard at runtime to PLR standard, we aim to generate out-of-the-box PLR definitions for all the labware in it over time, completing their PLR integration.

The resources displayed here are only the ones for which a PLR definition has been generated (to see the Opentrons definitions please read the appropriate .py files).
