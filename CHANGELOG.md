## Unreleased

### Changed

- The `offset` attribute of `Pickup`, `Drop`, `Aspirate`, and `Dispense` dataclasses are now always wrt the center of its `resource`.
- The `offset` parameter is no longer optional in `Pickup`, `Drop`, `Aspirate`, and `Dispense` dataclasses. With LiquidHandler it defaults to `Coordinate(0, 0, 0)`.
- When providing offsets to LH, individual items in the `offsets` list are no longer optional. They must be provided as `Coordinate` objects. The `offsets` list itself is still optional and defaults to `[Coordinate(0, 0, 0)]*len(use_channels)`.
- To aspirate from a single resource with multiple channels, you must now provide that single resource in a list when calling `LiquidHandler.aspirate` and `LiquidHandler.dispense`.
- The non-firmware level commands of `STAR` now take parameters in PLR-native units (mm, uL, mg, etc.) instead of the mixture of PLR-native and firmware-native units (0.1mm, 0.1uL, etc.) that were previously used. The affected commands are `pick_up_tips`, `drop_tips`, `aspirate`, `dispense`, `pick_up_tips96`, `drop_tips96`, `aspirate96`, `dispense96`, `iswap_pick_up_resource`, `iswap_move_picked_up_resource`, `iswap_release_picked_up_resource`, `core_pick_up_resource`, `core_move_picked_up_resource`, `core_release_picked_up_resource`, `move_resource`, and `core_check_resource_exists_at_location_center` (https://github.com/PyLabRobot/pylabrobot/pull/191).
- Also for Vantage, the units of the parameters are now in PLR-native units instead of the mixture of PLR-native and firmware-native units (0.1mm, 0.01uL, 0.1uL, etc.) that were previously used. The affected commands are `pick_up_tips`, `drop_tips`, `aspirate`, `dispense`, `pick_up_tips96`, `drop_tips96`, `aspirate96`, `dispense96`, `pick_up_resource`, and `release_picked_up_resource`.
- Fixed well z position: now it actually refers to the distance between the bottom of the well (including the material) and the bottom of the plate. Before, it sometimes mistakenly referred to what is now `material_z_thickness` (https://github.com/PyLabRobot/pylabrobot/pull/183).
- A resource's origin (lfb) is not changed on rotation, it is always fixed locally (https://github.com/PyLabRobot/pylabrobot/pull/195). Before, we updated the location after 90, 180, and 270 degree rotations.
- `Resource.rotate` and `Resource.rotated` now support all planes and all angles (before it was limited to 90 degree rotations around the z axis) (https://github.com/PyLabRobot/pylabrobot/pull/195)
- Resource children will not be relocated when the parent resource is rotated (https://github.com/PyLabRobot/pylabrobot/pull/195)
- `Resource.rotation` attribute is now a `Rotation` object (https://github.com/PyLabRobot/pylabrobot/pull/195)
- Parameters to higher-level STAR commands may be ints or floats, and will be converted to int when passed to the firmware-level commands.
- `ItemizedResource` now supports arbitrary patterns, not just full grids (https://github.com/PyLabRobot/pylabrobot/pull/201/):
  - Parameter `items` of `ItemizedResource.__init__` is deprecated in favor of `ordered_items`.
  - Rename parameter `identifier` of `ItemizedResource.get_items` to `identifiers`.
  - Attributes `ItemizedResource.num_items_x` and `ItemizedResource.num_items_y` are now computed, and raise an error when the grid is not rectangular/full.
  - `ItemizedResource` now serializes `"ordering"`, and not `"num_items_x"` and `"num_items_y"`.
- Merge `height_functions.py` and `volume_functions.py` into `height_volume_functions.py` (https://github.com/PyLabRobot/pylabrobot/pull/200)
- Type checking for `lh.pick_up_tips`, `lh.drop_tips`, `lh.aspirate`, and `lh.dispense` and 96-channel versions.
- `ChatterBoxBackend` outputs are now pretty (https://github.com/PyLabRobot/pylabrobot/pull/208)
- `liquid_height` now defaults to 0 instead of 1 (https://github.com/PyLabRobot/pylabrobot/pull/205/)
- `material_z_thickness` of a `Container` is used in computing its bottom (https://github.com/PyLabRobot/pylabrobot/pull/205/)
- Default `pickup_distance_from_top` in `LiquidHandler.{move_plate,move_lid}` were lowered by 3.33 (https://github.com/PyLabRobot/pylabrobot/pull/205/)
- `PlateCarrierSite` can now take `ResourceStack` as a child, as long as the children are `Plate`s (https://github.com/PyLabRobot/pylabrobot/pull/226)
- `Resource.get_size_{x,y,z}` now return the size of the resource in local space, not absolute space (https://github.com/PyLabRobot/pylabrobot/pull/235)
- `Resource.center` now returns the center of the resource in local space, not absolute space (https://github.com/PyLabRobot/pylabrobot/pull/235)
- Rename `ChatterBoxBackend` to `LiquidHandlerChatterboxBackend` (https://github.com/PyLabRobot/pylabrobot/pull/242)
- Move `LiquidHandlerChatterboxBackend` from `liquid_handling.backends.chatterbox_backend` to `liquid_handling.backends.chatterbox` (https://github.com/PyLabRobot/pylabrobot/pull/242)
- Changed `pedestal_size_z=-5` to `pedestal_size_z=-4.74` for `PLT_CAR_L5AC_A00` (https://github.com/PyLabRobot/pylabrobot/pull/255)
- rename `homogenization_` parameters in `STAR` to `mix_` (https://github.com/PyLabRobot/pylabrobot/pull/261)
- Lids no longer get special treatment when assigned to a ResourceStack. Assign them to a plate directly (https://github.com/PyLabRobot/pylabrobot/pull/267)

- `libusb_package` is now an optional dependency.
- Plates with a skirt are now correctly lowered when placed on plate carriers with a pedestal (https://github.com/PyLabRobot/pylabrobot/pull/205/)
